## 🏆 Top 5 High-Impact Features (Recommended)

### 1. 🎮 The 5-Minute Challenge (Viral Game)
**Concept:** Users guess how far they can travel, then see brutal reality.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🎯 THE 5-MINUTE CHALLENGE              │
│                                         │
│  From: Koramangala 4th Block            │
│  Mode: 🚗 Driving                       │
│                                         │
│  "Can you reach MG Road in 5 minutes?"  │
│                                         │
│     [ YES, EASY ]    [ MAYBE ]          │
│                                         │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────  │
│                                         │
│  😂 REALITY CHECK                       │

│  [ SHARE RESULT ]  [ TRY ANOTHER ]      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why it works:**
- Gamification drives engagement
- Results are inherently shareable
- Creates "I got roasted" social moments
- Can become daily challenge like Wordle

**Implementation:** Medium complexity - needs destination input + comparison logic

### 2. ⏰ Rush Hour Time-Lapse
**Concept:** Animated visualization showing how your "5-minute world" shrinks during rush hour.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⏰ YOUR 5 MINUTES THROUGHOUT THE DAY   │
│                                         │

│            Currently: 5:30 PM           │
│                                         │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐    │
│  │                                 │    │
│  │   [Animated shrinking blob]     │    │
│  │                                 │    │

│  │   Area at 5 PM: 2.1 km²  📉     │    │
│  │                                 │    │
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘    │
│                                         │

│   Ola driver took the scenic route"     │
│                                         │
